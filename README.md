# Moodle Grade Export Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet simplifies the process of extracting grades from Moodle's gradebook and transferring them directly to Lea's "Import Results" page.

## Features

-   Supports single and multiple assessments.
-   Automatically sums grades if multiple assessments are selected.
-   Allows customization of values for empty grades.
-   Generates clipboard-ready output for quick pasting into Lea.

## How to Use

1. Drag the "Copy Grades" button from the [website](https://vikramsinghmtl.github.io/moodlea/) to your bookmarks bar.

2. Navigate to your course's gradebook page on Moodle.

3. Click the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar:

    - Select one or more assessments.
    - Specify a value for empty grades (optional).
    - If multiple assessments are selected, grades will be summed for each student.

4. The grades will be copied to your clipboard. Paste them into Lea's "Import Results" page.

## Additional Notes

-   Ensure all students are displayed in the Moodle grader report (use the "Show" dropdown in the bottom-left corner).
-   To display real values instead of percentages in Moodle:
    1. Go to "Course grade settings" in the "Grader report" dropdown.
    2. Change the "Grade display type" to "Real" under "Grade item settings."
