# ðŸ’¯ Moodle Grades to Clipboard Bookmarklet

This repository contains a bookmarklet that helps teachers easily export grades from Moodle's gradebook and paste them into Leaâ€™s "Import Results" page.

## How It Works

The bookmarklet simplifies the process of transferring grades between Moodle and Lea by:

-   Extracting grades from Moodleâ€™s gradebook.
-   Formatting them for Lea's "Import Results" textarea.
-   Copying the data to the clipboard for easy pasting.

## Getting Started

1. [Visit the bookmarklet page hosted on GitHub Pages.](https://john-abbott-college.github.io/moodle-grades-to-clipboard/)

2. Drag the **Copy Grades** button from the page to your browser's bookmarks bar.

3. Follow the instructions on the webpage to use the bookmarklet.

## Usage

1. **On Moodle**:

    - Go to the Moodle gradebook page.
    - Click the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar.
    - Select the assessment and specify how to handle empty grades.
    - The grades are copied to your clipboard.

2. **On Lea**:
    - Go to Lea's "Import Results" page.
    - Paste the copied grades into the textarea.

## Notes

-   This bookmarklet works only on Moodle's gradebook page and Lea's import results page.
-   If you encounter issues, ensure you are on the correct pages and try again.
